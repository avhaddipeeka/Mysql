# Question 009: Filtering with the AND Operator

### Problem Statement
The `AND` operator is used when you want to filter records based on **multiple conditions**. For a row to be included in the result, **all** conditions separated by `AND` must be true.

**Task:** Write a query to find an employee whose **first_name** is 'John' **AND** whose **last_name** is 'Doe'.

---

### Key Concept: The AND Operator
The `AND` operator displays a record if both the first condition AND the second condition are met.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
```
**Hint**
Strings (text) in SQL are case-sensitive in many databases and must be wrapped in single quotes: 'John'.

**Solution**
[!TIP]
You can chain as many AND conditions as needed (e.g., WHERE cond1 AND cond2 AND cond3).

-- Retrieve the record where both first and last name match exactly
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE first_name = 'John' 
  AND last_name = 'Doe';
```
Comparison: AND vs. OR
AND: Requires ALL conditions to be true.
OR: Requires AT LEAST ONE condition to be true.
