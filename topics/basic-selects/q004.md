# Question 004: Retrieve All Employee Records

### Problem Statement
Once data is stored in a table, the most frequent task is viewing that data. You need to write a query that retrieves every column and every row from your table.

**Task:** Write a query to select all records from the `employees` table.

### Key Concept: The Asterisk (*) Wildcard
In SQL, the asterisk (`*`) is a wildcard character used to represent **all columns** in a table. It is a shortcut that prevents you from having to type out every column name (id, first_name, last_name, etc.) manually.

### Solution

```sql
-- Select every column and every row
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
