# Question 001: Initialize Your Workspace

### Problem Statement
In SQL, the first step to managing data is creating a container for your tables. Your task is to write a query that creates a new database dedicated to testing your scripts.

**Task:** Create a new database named `test`.

---

### Expected Command Structure
The query should use the Data Definition Language (DDL) command specifically designed for creating new database instances.

---

### Hint
Keywords in SQL are often written in **UPPERCASE** for better readability. The command follows this pattern: `KEYWORD` `OBJECT_TYPE` `NAME`.

---

### Solution
> [!TIP]
> Try to solve it yourself before looking at the code below!

```sql
-- Create a new database named test
CREATE DATABASE test;
```
