# Question 002: List All Databases

### Problem Statement
After creating a database, you often need to verify its existence or see what other environments are available on your server. 

**Task:** Write a query to display a list of all databases currently managed by your SQL server.

---

### Input/Environment
This command does not require a specific table, as it queries the database management system's metadata.

---

### Expected Output
A list or table showing the names of all databases (e.g., `information_schema`, `mysql`, `test`, `sys`).

---

### Solution
> [!NOTE]  
> This command varies slightly depending on which SQL flavor (Dialect) you are using.

#### For MySQL / MariaDB / Hive
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```
For PostgreSQL (Terminal/psql)
```sql
\l
-- or using a query:
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
```
