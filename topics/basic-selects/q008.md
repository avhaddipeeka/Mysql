# Question 008: Sorting Data with ORDER BY

### Problem Statement
When retrieving data, SQL does not guarantee a specific order unless you ask for one. To organize your results, you use the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Task:** Write a query to retrieve all employees, sorted by their **last_name** in alphabetical order (A-Z). Then, write a second query to sort them by **id** in descending order (highest to lowest).

### Key Concept: ORDER BY
The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

*   **`ASC`**: Sorts the data in ascending order (default).
*   **`DESC`**: Sorts the data in descending order.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
```
Part 1: Alphabetical Order (Ascending)

-- Sort by last name from A to Z
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY last_name ASC;
```
Part 2: Reverse Numeric Order (Descending)
-- Sort by ID from highest to lowest
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY id DESC;
```
