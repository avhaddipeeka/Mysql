# Question 010: SQL Comparison Operators

### Problem Statement
SQL uses operators in the `WHERE` clause to compare values. These are essential for filtering ranges (like dates or salaries) and finding data that *doesn't* match a specific value.

**Task:** Write two queries:
1. Find all employees with an **id greater than 2**.
2. Find all employees whose **last_name is NOT** 'Doe'.

---

### Key Concept: Comparison Operators
These symbols allow you to define precise logic for your data filters:

| Operator |	Description	| Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| =	| Equal to	| id = 5 |
| > |	Greater than |	id > 10 |
| <	| Less than	| id < 10 |
| >= |	Greater than or equal to | id >= 10 |
| <= |	Less than or equal to |	id <= 10 |
| <> or !=	| Not equal to	| last_name <> 'Smith' |

**Solution**
### Part 1: Greater Than
```sql
-- Select employees with an ID higher than 2
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE id > 2;
```

### Part 2: Not Equal To
```sql
-- Select employees whose last name is anything except 'Doe'
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE last_name <> 'Doe';
-- Note: '!=' also works in most modern SQL databases (2025).
```
