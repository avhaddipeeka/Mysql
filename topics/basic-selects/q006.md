# Question 006: The SELECT DISTINCT Statement

### Problem Statement
Sometimes a table contains duplicate values in certain columns. For example, multiple employees might share the same last name or be from the same city. If you want a list of unique values only, you use the `DISTINCT` keyword.

**Task:** Write a query to retrieve a list of all unique **last names** from the `employees` table.

---

### Key Concept: Removing Duplicates
The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to return only unique (different) values. It filters out all duplicate rows from the result set.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT first_name FROM employee;
```
Sometimes we want to list the different (distinct) values of each column.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name FROM employee;
```
