# Question 007: Filtering Data with the WHERE Clause

### Problem Statement
Often, you don't want to see every row in a table. You only want records that meet specific criteria. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.

**Task:** Write a query to find the **first name**, **last name**, and **mobile number** of the employee whose **id** is exactly `1`.

---

### Key Concept: The WHERE Clause
The `WHERE` clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. It follows the `FROM` clause.

**Common Operators:**
- `=` : Equal to
- `<>` or `!=` : Not equal to
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `LIKE` : Search for a pattern
- `IN` : To specify multiple possible values

---

### Hint
Since the `id` column was defined as a number (INT) in **q003**, you do not need to put quotes around the value. Use `WHERE id = 1`.

---

### Solution
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In SQL, text values must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `WHERE last_name = 'Doe'`), but numeric values should not be quoted.

```sql
-- Filter records to find a specific employee by ID
SELECT first_name, last_name, mobile
FROM employees
WHERE id = 1;
```
