# Question 005: Select Specific Columns

### Problem Statement
In production environments, it is rare to need every single column from a table. Retrieving only necessary columns reduces network traffic and improves query performance.

**Task:** Write a query to retrieve only the **first name**, **last name**, and **email** of all employees from the `employees` table.

---

### Key Concept: Column Selection
Instead of using the asterisk (`*`), you list the specific column names you want to see, separated by commas, immediately after the `SELECT` keyword.

**Syntax:**
`SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name;`

---

### Hint
Look back at the `employees` table schema from **q003**. The exact column names are `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`.

---

### Solution
> [!TIP]
> Always double-check your spelling and ensure there is a comma between each column name, but **not** after the last column name before `FROM`.

```sql
-- Retrieve specific contact details
SELECT first_name, last_name, email 
FROM employees;
```
